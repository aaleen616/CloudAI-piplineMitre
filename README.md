# CloudAI-Pipeline-MITRE

This project simulates a cloud-based machine learning pipeline inspired by a real-world internship at MITRE Insights. It showcases data ingestion, transformation, ML model retraining, and automated monitoring using AWS services.

## Features
- 🚀 Serverless Ingestion using AWS Lambda & S3
- 📊 ML Data Transformation with AWS Glue
- 🔁 Auto-Retraining with Lambda Trigger
- 👁️‍🗨️ Real-time Monitoring using CloudWatch Dashboards
- ✅ Built with Responsible AI, Security, and Accessibility in mind

## Setup
1. Deploy the Lambda scripts via AWS Console or CLI.
2. Configure Glue jobs using the provided `glue_transform.py`.
3. Upload data to the S3 bucket to trigger ingestion.
4. Set CloudWatch alarms and dashboards via `cloudwatch_dashboard.json`.
5. Automate retraining with `retrain_model.py`.

## Impact
- ⏱️ Report generation 35% faster
- 🧠 20% faster ML iteration cycles
- ⚠️ 28% faster incident response with monitoring
